# Rock Paper Scissors - Odin Foundations Course Project

### Introduction
This project is part of the Foundations Course, where we built a Rock Paper Scissors game. Initially, the game was console-based, but now we've added a graphical user interface (GUI) with buttons and visuals to improve user interaction. The project is designed to practice and demonstrate basic JavaScript skills, including functions, event handling, and DOM manipulation.

### Project Description
The goal of this project is to create a Rock Paper Scissors game where the player competes against the computer. The game is played with a GUI, allowing the player to select their move using buttons. The computer randomly selects a move, and the game compares the results. The first to score 5 points wins the game, with the current score and round results displayed on the screen.

### Features
- User Input via GUI: Players click buttons representing "rock," "paper," or "scissors" to make their move.
- Random Computer Selection: The computer randomly selects between "rock," "paper," or "scissors."
- Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the user's and computer's scores.
- Win/Lose/Draw Display: Results of each round are displayed in real-time, showing whether the user won, lost, or tied.
- Game Reset: A reset button allows users to start a new game at any time.
- Game Over Logic: Once a player scores 5 points, the game declares a winner and stops further play.

### How to Run the Project
1. Open the index.html file in a browser.
2. The game will be displayed with buttons for "rock," "paper," and "scissors."
3. Click a button to make your move. The game will update the score and display the result of each round.
4. Press the reset button to start a new game if needed.

### Skills Demonstrated
- JavaScript Basics: Implementing functions, conditionals, loops, and event listeners.
- DOM Manipulation: Using JavaScript to dynamically update HTML elements based on user actions.
- Responsive Design: The game interface adapts to different screen sizes for better user experience.
- User Interaction: Creating an interactive GUI with buttons and real-time feedback.

### How to Play
1. Choose either "rock," "paper," or "scissors" by clicking the corresponding button.
2. The computer will automatically choose its move.
3. The result of the round will be displayed (Win, Lose, or Draw), and the score will be updated.
4. The game continues until either the player or the computer scores 5 points, at which point the game announces the winner.
5. Click the reset button to start over.

### Future Enhancements
- Add animations or effects to enhance the user experience.
- Introduce sound effects for a more engaging gameplay experience.
- Implement additional game modes, such as best-of-3 or a timed challenge.
