# Rock Paper Scissors - Odin Foundations Course Project

### Introduction
This project is part of the Foundations Course, where we will build a simple Rock Paper Scissors game. The game is played entirely in the console, and this project focuses on applying basic JavaScript skills like function creation, control flow, and user interaction. The graphical user interface (GUI) is not included at this stage and will be added later.

### Project Description
The goal of the project is to create a Rock Paper Scissors game where the player competes against the computer. The game plays five rounds, keeps score, and announces a winner at the end. Each round compares the player's choice with the computer's randomly selected choice and displays the result in the console.

### Features
- The player can input their choice of "rock", "paper", or "scissors."
- The computer randomly selects between "rock", "paper", or "scissors."
- A round result is displayed in the console (Win, Lose, or Draw).
- The game plays 5 rounds, tracks the score, and declares an overall winner at the end.

### How to Run the Project
1. Open the project HTML file in a browser.
2. Open the browser's developer tools (usually by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting "Inspect").
3. Go to the "Console" tab.
4. The game will be played entirely in the console, where the player will be prompted to enter their choices, and the round results will be displayed.

### Skills Demonstrated
- JavaScript basics: Function declarations, variables, control flow, and conditionals.
- DOM manipulation: Even though we aren't using a GUI yet, the foundation is set to move towards interacting with the web document.
- Problem-solving: Following a structured approach to break down problems and implement solutions.

### How to Play
1. The player inputs their choice when prompted (rock, paper, or scissors).
2. The computer randomly selects a choice.
3. The winner of each round is announced in the console.
4. After 5 rounds, the final scores are tallied, and the overall winner is declared.

### Future Enhancements
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) with buttons and visuals.
- Improve user interaction and experience by showing real-time feedback outside the console.
